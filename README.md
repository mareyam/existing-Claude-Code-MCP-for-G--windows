# Gmail & Calendar Multi-Account MCP Server

A local [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that connects multiple Gmail accounts and Google Calendars to Claude Desktop. Runs entirely on your machine — no cloud hosting required.

## Features

- **Multiple accounts** — connect as many Gmail or Google Workspace accounts as you need
- **Unified email search** — search across all accounts simultaneously with Gmail's full query syntax
- **Full read access** — read individual messages and entire threads
- **Send & draft** — compose and send emails, or save drafts, from any account
- **Label management** — list labels, mark as read/unread, star messages
- **Google Calendar** — list calendars, browse upcoming events, search by keyword

## Requirements

- macOS (tested on macOS 14+)
- Python 3.11+
- A Google Cloud project with the Gmail API and Calendar API enabled (free)
- Claude Desktop

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DiegoMaldonadoRosas/gmail-mcp.git
cd gmail-mcp
```

### 2. Run the setup script

```bash
bash setup.sh
```

This creates a virtual environment and installs all Python dependencies.

### 3. Configure your accounts

Copy the example config and fill in your accounts:

```bash
cp config.json.example config.json
```

Edit `config.json`:

```json
{
  "accounts": {
    "personal": {
      "email": "you@gmail.com",
      "description": "Personal Gmail",
      "signature_html": "<div><br>--<br><strong>Your Name</strong><br>example.com</div>",
      "signature_image_path": "./signatures/personal.png"
    },
    "work": {
      "email": "you@company.com",
      "description": "Work account",
      "signature_image_path": "./signatures/work.png"
    }
  },
  "credentials_dir": "./credentials"
}
```

The account keys (`personal`, `work`) are the names you'll use when asking Claude to interact with a specific account.

#### Per-account signatures (optional)

Each account can have its own email signature, applied automatically to every
message it sends — you never pass signature info as a tool parameter.

| Field | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `signature_html` | If set, this HTML block is appended to the HTML part of every outgoing email from that account. Takes priority over `signature_image_path`. |
| `signature_image_path` | Used **only** when `signature_html` is not set. The image is embedded inline at the bottom of the email (via `Content-ID` / `<img src="cid:...">`), so it appears as a signature image, not a file attachment. Path is relative to the project root or absolute. |

If neither field is set, emails are sent with no signature. A plain-text body is
always included as a fallback for clients that don't render HTML.

### 4. Get Google OAuth credentials

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a project and enable both the **Gmail API** and the **Google Calendar API**
3. Go to **APIs & Services → Credentials → + Create Credentials → OAuth 2.0 Client ID**
4. Choose **Desktop app** as the application type
5. Download the JSON file and save it as `credentials/client_secret.json`
6. Go to **APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen → Test users** and add every email address you configured in `config.json`

### 5. Authenticate your accounts

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python setup_auth.py
```

A browser window will open for each account. Sign in with the correct Google account. Tokens are saved locally and refreshed automatically — you only need to do this once per account.

> **Note:** If you previously authenticated for Gmail only, you must re-run `setup_auth.py` after adding Calendar support so the tokens include the new Calendar permissions.

### 6. Add the server to Claude Desktop

Open `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` and add:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gmail": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/gmail-mcp/.venv/bin/python",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/gmail-mcp/server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/absolute/path/to/gmail-mcp` with the actual path where you cloned the repo.

### 7. Restart Claude Desktop

All tools will appear automatically.

## Usage Examples

Once connected, you can ask Claude things like:

**Email:**
- *"Do I have any unread emails in my work account?"*
- *"Search for invoices received in the last month across all my accounts"*
- *"Read the last email from John in my personal account"*
- *"Draft a reply to the budget email in my work account"*
- *"Mark all emails from newsletter@example.com as read"*

**Calendar:**
- *"What meetings do I have this week in my work account?"*
- *"Search for events related to 'product launch' in my personal calendar"*
- *"List all my calendars in my work account"*
- *"What are the details of tomorrow's standup?"*

## Adding a New Account

1. Add the account to `config.json`
2. Add the email as a Test User in Google Cloud Console (OAuth consent screen)
3. Run `python setup_auth.py` — it will only prompt for the new account
4. Restart Claude Desktop

## Security

- OAuth tokens are stored locally in `credentials/tokens/` and are excluded from version control via `.gitignore`
- `config.json` (which contains your email addresses) is also excluded from version control
- Nothing is sent to any third-party server — all communication is directly between your Mac and Google's APIs
- To revoke access at any time, visit [myaccount.google.com/permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions)
